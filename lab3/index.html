					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The Challenge of this lab was only double checking

					</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't really have any problems with this lab, I found it pretty straightforward </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This assignemt felt pretty easy compered to others, since I had tried to figure out
						how to start doing this during the last lab, so I had already given myself a head start on it!
						I didnt put a lot of extra energy this week, but last week before looking at this weeks lab
						I looked through the slideshows that we had seen so far and figured out how to start the linking 
						process </p>

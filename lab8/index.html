			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to expirment with Anonymous functions, as well as callbacks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't really know what to do with this lab at first and was pretty freaked out. But then I played aroudn with numbers and random inputs and played with functions in the window of the lab and I got some stuff working finally </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I was worried about the experimentation because when asking wesbot for help, it said that the instructions were clear and simple for this 
						lab, but I'm less unsure of what is  going on after attending section and lecture, I felt more confident that I did know what to do.

					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> My results show up when you open my lab page! I had some help from Ilia in section, but I played around with a fuction that would change the color of the website page 
						depending on what color you typed in! For this to work I had to get rid of existing .css stuff I had already for the page so that the command would work

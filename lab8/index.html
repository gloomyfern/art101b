			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to expirment with Anonymous functions, as well as callbacks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I genuinely don't really know what to do with this lab. I played aroudn with numbers and random inputs but nothing would come out for me </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I am worried about the experimentation because when asking wesbot for help, it said that the instructions were clear and simple for this 
						lab, but I'm still quite unsure of what is even going on, I'm really worried about getting stuck here...
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> My results won't show up here, I messed around in javascript for a long time using the differnt instructions but I dont actually understand what they're doing, however they do show up correctly in the console on Chrome</p>

                 <h2>Results-</h2>
                <p> My results were actually that I didnt have any bugs other than image loading, however I couldnt fix the images
                    that wouldnt load becuse in the earlier labs they were picutres of my code that I had deleted, so unfortunately I'm not super sure how to retrieve those without restarting things...

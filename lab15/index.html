                    I'm havign trouble understanding how to define the data on my own, i belive something is possibly wrong with using pokimonapi because of the varaibles or something? I can't seem to find what the data would be on the website.
                </p>

                <div id="Results" class="tabcontent">
                 <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>  unfortunately my data isnt showing for some reason, I decided to use in class work that we did ther other day and use that to create my js work, I couldn't get pokimonapi to work unfortunately, I think
                    the link was being weird

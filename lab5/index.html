			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types/Variables</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab showed me how I could implement javascript into my html file directly, using the correct links</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The main problemm I ran into involced the fact that I miswrote "writeln" as "writteeln" and it was super consuing to me to figure out What
						on earth I was doing wrong, becuase my brain ignored the spelling error I guess when I looked at it
						eventually I went through both my html file code lines and javascript and figured it out after a few hours
						I asked wesbot and discussed with my partner as well, I just assumed I had dont soemthing wrong in the html.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I put a lot of time into this assignment, I wanted to make sure that there weren't any errors with my code, and was insanely
						frustrated that my script output just kept not working, even after messing with it for so long, im glad I finally realized the issue though! </p>
